<span class='line'> 10</span> 
<span class='line'> 11</span>   __NOTE:__ SC.StaticLayout is now built in to SC.View.  You do not need to 
<span class='line'> 12</span>   apply this mixin to use static layout.  Just set useStaticLayout to YES.
<span class='line'> 13</span>   
<span class='line'> 14</span>   Normally, SproutCore views use absolute positioning to display themselves
<span class='line'> 15</span>   on the screen.  While this is both the fastest and most efficient way to 
<span class='line'> 16</span>   display content in the web browser, sometimes your user interface might need
<span class='line'> 17</span>   to take advantage of the more advanced "flow" layout offered by the browser
<span class='line'> 18</span>   when you use static and relative positioning.
<span class='line'> 19</span>   
<span class='line'> 20</span>   This mixin can be added to a view class to enable the use of any kind of 
<span class='line'> 21</span>   static and relative browser positionining.  In exchange for using static
<span class='line'> 22</span>   layout, you will lose a few features that are normally available on a view
<span class='line'> 23</span>   class such as the 'frame' and 'clippingFrame' properties as well as 
<span class='line'> 24</span>   notifications when your view or parentView are resized.
<span class='line'> 25</span>   
<span class='line'> 26</span>   Normally, if you are allowing the browser to manage the size and positioning
<span class='line'> 27</span>   of your view, these feature will not be useful to your code anyway.
<span class='line'> 28</span>   
<span class='line'> 29</span>   h2. Using StaticLayout
<span class='line'> 30</span>   
<span class='line'> 31</span>   To enable static layout on your view, just include this mixin on the view.
<span class='line'> 32</span>   SproutCore's builtin views that are capable of being used in static 
<span class='line'> 33</span>   layouts already incorporate this mixin.  Then set the "useStaticLayout" 
<span class='line'> 34</span>   property on your view class to YES.
<span class='line'> 35</span>   
<span class='line'> 36</span>   You can then use CSS or the render() method on your view to setup the 
<span class='line'> 37</span>   positioning on your view using any browser layout mechanism you want.
